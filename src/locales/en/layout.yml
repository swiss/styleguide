      You can use `.form-horizontal` on `<form>` to display the label aligned at the left of the input. `.form-group` then behaves like a `.row`.

      Input boxes allow the user to input content (e.g. name).
      For inputting dates, an HTML5 solution is available. With browsers that do not support HTML5 the date has to be input manually.
      The following has to be taken into account for barrier-free accessibility:
      The name of the form and the form box must be linked to a label. A label ID may only appear once on a page. Required fields must have sensible names or, preferably, use WAI.

      You can use the `.has-error`, `.has-warning` or `.has-success` classes to send feedback to the user.

      HTML5 input types: `text`, `password`, `datetime`, `datetime-local`, `date`, `month`, `time`, `week`, `number`, `email`, `url`, `search`, `tel`, and `color`

      The designation of a website allows the user to recognize at a glance who the originator of the site is together with the website's content and purpose.

      The designation consists of the Confederation logo (coat of arms and the four-language wordmark) and the name of the organizational unit, including its abbreviation (e.g. EDA), or as a short form (e.g. MeteoSchweiz).

      These two components are separated from one another by a vertical line. For smartphones only the coat of arms from the Confederation logo is used in the header. The name of the organizational unit can be abbreviated. The appropriate HTML code for this is provided together with the Globalnavigation.

      The full form of the Confederation logo is given in the Footer.

      The logo is a CD element. Its use is mandatory, and its representation may not be changed in any way.

      The predefined color range is intended to make the family of Confederation websites instantly recognizable, to emphasize individual elements and interactions, and is also used for orientation purposes. The color range employed is a CD element, and its use is mandatory.

      Three colors are used: the red shade of the Confederation logo, which is complemented by a lighter shade of red, a blue tone, and a range of gray shades.

      The red color is used in the red line which marks the bottom of the header, and it is also used to indicate a selection in the navigation as well as for mouseovers on links. Otherwise, various shades of gray are used. For instance, the headlines and the body copy are presented in a dark shade of gray.

      For an **inside-icon** element, use the global `.icon` and `.icon--before` or `.icon--after` class followed by the more specific class.

      **Accessibility**

      If the element should be readable by a screen reader and/or is semantically important, be sure to add the appropriate `aria-` attribute. Otherwise, add an `aria-hidden="true"` attribute to hide it and avoid useless clutter of informations.

      You could also add a `<span class="sr-only">icon description</span>` depending on your needs.

      Headings serve to structure the content of a page. The higher the heading is in the structural hierarchy (e.g. H1), the more important it is, and the more weight is given to it by search engines such as Google. Generally speaking, not too many hierarchical levels should be used, as this has a negative impact on the clarity of the structure. Heading levels H1 through H4 are therefore clearly differentiated in their formatting (while levels H5 and H6 are merely defined pro forma).

      To conform accessibiliity requirement titles have to respect a sequence from 1 to 6

      Headings can also have links and are then formatted in blue.

      There are two exceptions to this rule:
      If there is a link in the running text, the linked text is underlined. Links in a navigation element (e.g. in the global navigation) are gray, and not blue.
