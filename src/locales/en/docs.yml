    # The presentation of the Swiss Federal Administration on the Internet

    The Confederation Web Guidelines define the design specifications for the presentation of the Swiss Federal Administration on the Internet and are binding for all websites within the domain admin.ch. These guidelines specify how the websites of the Federal authorities have to look and how they should behave. At the same time they give the government departments and public offices the necessary flexibility to be able to optimize their online communications to the requirements of their specific business purposes.

    These design regulations allow web designers to create up-to-date, user-friendly and universally accessible websites. They define the compulsory corporate design elements as well as the obligatory navigation and content modules. Furthermore, they introduce a series of elements that can be used directly and, if required, expanded upon or further developed. The display presentation has been optimized for web browsers on both desktop computers and laptops as well as on tablets and smartphones.

    The Confederation Web Guidelines are aimed at both internal Federal project managers and third party service providers. They offer project managers an overview of the design specifications. Developer teams can use the templates and elements directly. They have been created using standard HTML code (as of 2013) and can be used with CSS and JavaScript style sheets.

    The design specifications described for use on the Internet or in intranets can also be used for other digital channels, such as for the creation of apps.

    The elements and modules described can be categorized in three groups:

    ## 1. Corporate Design Elements <span class="label label-admin">CD</span>

    The corporate design elements identify the website definitively as websites of the Confederation and for this reason their use is obligatory. Their presentation and design are set out in the Confederation CD, and they may not be modified in any way. Changes to these elements may only be implemented by the Specialist Unit for the Confederation CD or by the KID (Information Services Conference of the Administrative Departments). The CD elements are:

      - designation of the website, comprising the Confederation logo and the name of the organizational unit
      - red line separating the header from the rest of the page
      - footbar with the copyright notice, links to the legal notice and further legal information
      - “Frutiger” typeface
      - prescribed color range

    The CD elements are marked with the following icon in the detailed descriptions: Corporate

    ## 2. Fixed Elements <span class="label label-admin">FIX</span>

    The use of fixed elements is not mandatory. However, if they are used, their position and design are fixed and unalterable. For this reason they may not be modified in any way. Changes or additions to the following elements require the approval of the Web Forum:

      - all other header elements (treecrumb, service navigation, language selection, search box, topics A-Z box)
      - global navigation
      - navigation in the left sidebar
      - Breadcrumb
      - social media links in the footer
      - partner links in the footer
      - site map in the footer
      - social sharing function
      - print function
      - “back to overview” link
      - typographical rules

    Fixed elements are marked with the following icon in the detailed descriptions: Fixed

    ## 3. Flexible Elements <span class="label label-admin">FLEX</span>

    The descriptions of all other elements are recommendations. They can and may be adapted to meet specific requirements. They can be freely expanded upon and modified. The general look and feel of the site must, however, be retained. Additions to and amendments of these elements can be presented to the Web Forum for consideration as part of the web guidelines.

      - faceted navigation
      - picture gallery
      - contact box
      - etc.

    Flexible elements are marked with the following icon in the detailed descriptions: Flexbile

    Moreover, each project is entitled, within the scope of the framework created for the Confederation CD and the fixed elements, to develop its own elements. Any such newly created elements can be presented to the Web Forum for consideration as part of the web guidelines.

    ## Revision and Further Development of the Confederation Web Guidelines

    The Confederation Web Forum will review the Confederation Web Guidelines annually to ensure that they remain up-to-date and conform to developments in the web. If required and in consultation with the KID, the service providers, and the Specialist Unit for the Confederation CD, the Confederation Web Forum will initiate a release update of the Guidelines.

    Extensions to existing elements, as well as new elements that are not yet included in these Confederation Web Guidelines, may be proposed to the Specialist Unit for the Confederation CD. This Unit will consider the proposal for submission to the Confederation Web Forum. The Confederation Web Forum will subsequently determine whether the proposed change should be added to the Confederation Web Guidelines or not. If the former is the case, the Forum will propose the relevant amendment to the KID.

    If the KID agrees to the amendment, the submitting body will implement the amendment. In the course of this implementation process, the applicant will ensure that the code, together with a description of the amendment, is passed on to the Specialist Unit for the Confederation CD. The Unit will add the amendment to the Guidelines and inform the service providers of the change.
accessibility:
  title: Barrier-free Accessibility
  intro: |
    All of the Confederation’s Internet resources must be designed in such a way as to enable people with disabilities to use them without restrictions. The Federal Administration is committed to fulfilling the requirements of the “Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0” to conformance level AA.

    Additional Information:

    [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/)

    [The Guidelines of the Confederation (P028)](https://www.isb.admin.ch/isb/de/home/ikt-vorgaben/prozesse-methoden/p028-richtlinien_bund_gestaltung_barrierefreie_internetangebote.html)

    ## Best practices

    This section provides Accessibility compliant examples for commonly encountered situations.

  title-tag: |
    ### Page title

    It is recommended to use commas to separate different segments of the "title" tag's content.

  multi-language: |
    ### Multi-language content

    Sometimes, on the same page, there is content in different languages. The "lang" atttribute can be used to notify the Screen readers of the language switch.

basic-grid:
  title: Basic Grid and Page Types
  content: |
    ## Basic Grid

    The websites are made up of three segments:

    the header, the four-column content section, and the footer.

    <figure>
      <img src="/styleguide-img/grid.png" alt="Page grid example">
      <figcaption>The four-column grid is used in different ways by the various page types</figcaption>
    </figure>

    ## Page Types

    Basically, there are two page types; the home page and the content page. There are also some mixed forms and special pages (see “Sample Pages”).

    ## Home page

    The home page is made up of the header (that can contain the global navigation section, which is explained in the Elements Page, the teaser section, and the footer. The teaser section is divided into four columns. There are many different teasers for the various applications, and these are listed in the “Content Modules” section and described in detail there. The teasers can be used flexibly in the teaser section. For instance, a focus teaser can be spread over three columns, while a person teaser with a portrait of the responsible Federal Councillor can be limited to one column.

    ## Content Page

    A content page also has a header and a footer. In place of the teaser section, this page has a four-column content section. The column on the left is used as the left navigation bar, the two columns in the middle are set aside for the content proper, while the column on the right is used as the context pane.

    ### Left Navigation Bar

    The navigation used on the left of the content section is dynamic, meaning that the subsections of the page currently in use are always shown. There are three parts to the navigation: a link back to the previous level, the navigation header with the title of the current page, and the actual navigation with links to the sub-pages. Its use is described on the Elements Page.

    ### Content Section

    The content section contains the title and subtitle of the page, the body copy, the images, info boxes, and further information. The further information section is always positioned as the last element in the content section and should not be placed in the context pane. Usability tests have shown that users paid little attention to the information contained in the context pane.

    ### Context Pane

    The context pane is reserved for the following elements: wherever it makes sense to do so, a direct contact should be placed at the very top. If there is a shopping cart element, this is placed directly under the contact box. Teasers, such as an RSS feed box or a temporary teaser (for instance for a conference) can also be placed in this section. However, in no case is it possible to have more than three elements here. If using any of the elements listed here does not make sense, then the column remains blank.

    No additional information and no essential content components may be placed in the context pane, with the exception of the elements mentioned above.
cd-elements:
  title: CD Elements
  content: |
    The consistent use of CD elements provides for a branded look and feel across all the websites of the Confederation. It ensures that a website is immediately recognizable as a Confederation website. It also conveys to the user the fundamental values underlying the daily work of the Federal Administration: quality, efficiency, and transparency.

    The use of the following central CD elements is mandatory. They are set out in the Confederation CD and may not be modified in any way. Any changes to these elements are adopted by the GSK at the request of the Specialist Unit for the Confederation CD:

    - the designation, comprising the Confederation logo, the name of the organizational unit, and the gray separating line between these two elements
    - the red line marking the bottom of the header
    - the color range used: red for selection, blue for text links, and a variety of gray shades.
    - the consistent use of the “Frutiger” typeface
    - a uniform footbar (with the copyright notice, the legal notice, and further legal information)

    ## Clear Designation of the Website

    The originator of the website is always identified via the full form of the Confederation logo (coat of arms and the four-language wordmark) and the name of the organizational unit, including its abbreviation or shortened form. These two components are separated from one another by a vertical line. The designation is always positioned at the top left of the header. As an alternative to the organizational unit, the title of the website may also be shown.

    <figure>
      <img src="/styleguide-img/kennzeichnung.png" alt="Page grid example">
      <figcaption>The designation comprises the full form of the Confederation logo, and the name of the organizational unit, as well as a separating line.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    ## Implementation for Smartphones

    For applications in which space for the header is limited, the coat of arms can be used on its own without the wordmark. The name of the organizational unit can be given in its abbreviated form (e.g. EDA) or as a short form (e.g. MeteoSchweiz). Organizational units for which there is no abbreviation or short form are written in full. This can mean that the designation covers several lines and the height of the header section is increased to accommodate the name.

    <figure>
      <img src="/styleguide-img/mobile_header.png" alt="Page grid example">
      <figcaption>For the designation on smartphones the abbreviation can also be used. If the name of the organizational unit has to be written out in full, the designation may cover several lines.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    In cases where the shorter form of the designation is used in the header, the footer must contain the full form of the Confederation logo with the coat of arms and the four-language wordmark.

    In mobile devices, the complete name of the organizational unit is shown together with the language selection in a drawer section above the header. This section is hidden automatically the first time the user scrolls down.

    ![image](/styleguide-img/schublade.png)

    ## Separating Line below the Header

    The red separating line marks the bottom of the header. It can also indicate a field selected in the global navigation.

    ![image](/styleguide-img/rotelinie.png)

    ## Typography

    The “Frutiger” typeface has been selected for use throughout all Internet applications. In intranets the “Arial” typeface is used.

    ## Interaction Colors

    Interactive elements are either indicated by their position (e.g. in the navigation) or are marked by the color blue. Selected elements are red.

    ## Foot Bar

    The uniform foot bar closes the pages. It contains a copyright notice as well as links to the “legal notice” and “further legal information”.

    ## Favicon

    Don't forget the favicon before putting the website in production. The favicon ressources are located in the `/build/img/ico/` directory. Include them with the adequate code:

    ```html
    <link rel="shortcut icon" href="build/img/ico/favicon.ico">
    <link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="57x57" href="build/img/ico/apple-touch-icon-57x57.png">
    <link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="114x114" href="build/img/ico/apple-touch-icon-114x114.png">
    <link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="72x72" href="build/img/ico/apple-touch-icon-72x72.png">
    <link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="144x144" href="build/img/ico/apple-touch-icon-144x144.png">
    <link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="60x60" href="build/img/ico/apple-touch-icon-60x60.png">
    <link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="120x120" href="build/img/ico/apple-touch-icon-120x120.png">
    <link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="76x76" href="build/img/ico/apple-touch-icon-76x76.png">
    <link rel="icon" type="image/png" href="build/img/ico/favicon-96x96.png" sizes="96x96">
    <link rel="icon" type="image/png" href="build/img/ico/favicon-16x16.png" sizes="16x16">
    <link rel="icon" type="image/png" href="build/img/ico/favicon-32x32.png" sizes="32x32">
    <meta name="msapplication-TileColor" content="#ffffff">
    <meta name="msapplication-TileImage" content="build/img/ico/mstile-144x144.png">
    <meta name="msapplication-config" content="build/img/ico/browserconfig.xml">
    ```
devices:
  title: Output across a Range of End Devices
  content: |
    The Confederation Web Guidelines facilitate optimized output of all the content on a website on various end devices such as desktop computers, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. The layout of the individual web pages and the individual elements adapts on the fly to the viewing environment of the output device.

    ## Desktop Computers, Laptops, and Tablets

    For desktop computers, laptops, and tablets held in landscape mode, the original layout is retained. As soon as a tablet is held in portrait mode, the content of the right-hand column (the context pane) is shown below the content.

    <figure>
      <img src="/styleguide-img/responsive.png" alt="Page grid example">
      <figcaption>The contents are arranged and displayed differently on different end devices</figcaption>
    </figure>

    ## Mobile Devices / Smartphones

    If the page is displayed on a smartphone, only the content is shown. The navigation function in the left sidebar disappears, as does the context pane. Instead, the user can navigate via links in the footer and a special menu for mobile devices.

    Usability tests have shown that many smartphone users ignore the navigation menu in the header and navigate via links in the footer. It is therefore important to reproduce the navigation in the footer.

    ## Structure of the Confederation Web Guidelines

    Navigation to the individual chapters within the Confederation Web Guidelines is via the tabs in the main menu.

    The chapter entitled “Design Principles” summarizes the fundamental principles of the Confederation Web Guidelines.

    The tabs “Base Layout”, “Navigation Modules”, and “Content Modules” contain detailed descriptions of the individual elements.

    On the individual pages, the element is presented first of all in a scalable frame. When the frame is enlarged or reduced in size, the presentation of the element can be tested for responsiveness on various output devices. Above the representation of the element lives a brief description of it. Below it, the HTML code for implementation by the development team can be displayed. The code given in the HTML tab can be copied and reused.

    In the section “Example Pages”, various types of web page are presented. They can be scaled directly and the presentation tested on various screen sizes.

    ## Examples Used

    The Confederation Web Guidelines were the outcome of pilot projects initiated by the EDA (Federal Department of Foreign Affairs) and the VBS (Federal Department of Defence, Civil Protection and Sport). This explains some of the examples and terms used in the visualizations (e.g. the terminology in the global navigation). These Web Guidelines primarily contain definitions pertaining to the functional and creative design of the website. They make no reference to the information architecture, nor do they prescribe the terminology to be used.

    ## Usage

    Please follow [these instructions](https://github.com/swiss/styleguide#the-swiss-federal-administration-on-the-internet) to use the styleguide into your project.

    ## Web Browsers Supported

    The presentation of the elements has been optimized for all recent browsers and devices.

    ### Desktop optimisation:

    - Internet Explorer 9 and higher
    - Safari 9 and higher
    - Firefox 38 and higher

header-footer:
  title: Header and Footer
  content: |
    The header and footer appear on all pages and have a predefined design. Their presentation is modified for use on mobile devices.

    ## Header

    The header is the defining element of a website. It consists of the treecrumb navigation of the Federal Administration, the service navigation including language selection, the designation (Confederation logo plus name of the organizational unit or the title of the website), the search box and the topics A-Z box. This section is always separated from the rest of the page by a red line at the bottom of it.

    These elements are either CD elements or fixed elements. They may not be amended in any way.

    <figure>
      <img src="/styleguide-img/header.png" alt="Page grid example">
      <figcaption>The header with its key elements</figcaption>
    </figure>

    The **Treecrumb** shows the position of the website within the hierarchical organization of the Federal Administration. It allows the user to access directly the websites of higher-level organizational units. The treecrumb navigation is not used on mobile devices.

    The **Service Navigation** provides links to topics of overriding importance (e.g. Contact, Jobs, Media and Contact) and also contains the language navigation. Ideally, there should be three, but in no case should there be more than five links in the service navigation. At the very least there must be the Contact link and the Language selection link. On mobile devices the links in the service navigation are moved to the footer.

    To the right of the service navigation is the **language selection**. The languages available are represented by their abbreviations as per ISO-Norm ISO 639-1 in the following order: German: DE, French: FR, Italian: IT, Romansh: RM, English: EN. It is mandatory to offer the choice of one of the official languages DE, FR, and IT on every Federal Administration website. If there is no content available in one of these languages, the relevant link is not active. A tooltip shows that the content is not available in the language selected. The RM and EN language choices are only shown when the relevant content is actually available in these languages. Sites which use more than 5 languages can use a dropdown menu for the other languages in place of the fifth language. However, DE, FR, IT and RM are all always given in their short form as links.
    The language navigation is aligned flush left with the search box and the topics A-Z box.
    The language selection on mobile devices follows the regulations set out above.

    The designation, comprising the Confederation logo (coat of arms and wordmark) and the name of the organizational unit, is the most important CD element. In websites that cover several organizations or in theme portals, the name of the organizational unit is replaced by the title of the website. On mobile devices the wordmark in the Confederation logo in the header may be omitted, and the name of the organizational unit abbreviated or shortened. If the name is abbreviated, its full form is given in a section above the header. This section disappears when the user starts to scroll.

    The **search function** is placed as a text box on the right-hand side of the header opposite the designation. When the user clicks on the text box, the box is enlarged.
    On mobile devices the search function can be accessed via an icon in the header.

    The **topics A-Z** is positioned under the search box. This is an alternative means of access to the contents of the website, which can be selected from an alphabetical catalog of topics. On mobile devices the A-Z navigation is offered together with the search function.

    The bottom of the header is always indicated by a red line If a global navigation function is used below the header, this line can also highlight a selected section via a colored marking.

    ## Global Navigation

    Most websites have a global navigation function comprising a series of tabs in a section positioned below the red line closing the header. This global navigation represents the highest navigation level. Its purpose is to show the topics covered on the website in order to give an overview of the website’s content and purpose.

    If the following topics are included in the website, they must have the names used here and be placed in the position given in parentheses after their names: “Latest News” (first), “Publications and Services” (second-last), and “About Us” (last). All other terms for the global navigation section have not been defined by the Confederation Web Guidelines, but should be as brief and to the point as possible. They are dependent on the specific communications requirements of the individual department or public office.

    Websites which do not contain a lot of content can do without the global navigation function and limit navigation to the left sidebar in the content section (for details, see Sample Pages, “Home Page without Global Navigation”).

    ## Footer

    The footer contains important links, making them thereby immediately accessible on all the pages of a website. These links can refer to pages in the website itself but also to external content (such as the authority’s social media platform). If required, the footer can be divided into various sections.

    The footbar below the footer contains the copyright notice, and links to the “legal notice” and “further legal information”. The footbar is a CD element. Its use is mandatory.

    <figure>
      <img src="/styleguide-img/footer.png" alt="Page grid example">
      <figcaption>The footer with its various sections</figcaption>
    </figure>

    On mobile devices, many of the functions from the header (e.g. navigation, service navigation, and the full form of the Confederation logo) are moved to the footer.
sample-pages:
  title: Sample Pages
  content: |
    Ten different sample pages are shown in the Confederation Web Guidelines, all of them based on the page types “Home page” and “Content Page”. They were created in the course of the EDA, VBS, and BFS (Federal Statistic Office) projects, and they exemplify how the various elements presented can be combined on web pages. These sample pages can be used as the basis for a project and can be adapted, expanded, or modified as required.

    ## Home Page with Global Navigation

    This sample page is suitable for websites with a large volume of information (“large websites”, such as www.eda.admin.ch or www.vbs.admin.ch). The global navigation (first navigation level) is combined with a mega flyout menu (second and possibly also third navigation level). The first and second navigation levels serve to group the content and have no content of their own.

    ## Home Page without Global Navigation

    Websites with a lower volume of information (such as the websites of the Swiss embassies) use the home page without global navigation. In such cases the user accesses the content directly via the left sidebar sub-navigation.

    ## Sub-Home Page

    Sub-home pages make it possible to use all the elements of the home page on pages that are on a lower navigation level. They are intended to allow subordinate organizational units to have their own home page. Every sub-home page has a left sidebar. There is no context pane. A sub-home page can have its own short URL (e.g. www.luftwaffe.ch) to allow direct access.

    ## Overview Page

    The overview page is based on the content page type, so it has a global navigation section, a left sidebar, and a context pane. It is used to provide a conspicuous point of access to a topic. The various sections of this topic or the subpages (child pages) are introduced in a two-column list of teasers in the middle section.

    ## Navigation Page

    This page type is used as a fallback solution for browsers that do not support JavaScript and therefore cannot use the global navigation. This page type is also shown when a user views a navigation node containing no content of its own.

    ## Detail Page

    The detail page is a classical content page with an article in the middle column.

    ## Unattached Detail Page

    When a detail page is not rooted in the navigation but was accessed via a link in the content of a page on a higher navigation level, it is provided with a “Back to…” link.

    ## Publications Page

    A publications page is a special unattached detail page on which a publication is presented and can be ordered by the user. The right column contains a shopping cart for this purpose.

    ## Search Results

    The search results page does not contain left sidebar navigation. The search results are placed on the three columns on the right of the basic grid.

    ## Webform Page

    The sample page for webforms shows how a form and its navigation process look on a page.
