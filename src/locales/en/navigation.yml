    title: Global Navigation
    help: |
      The global navigation shows the main points of access to a website as tabs. It is separated from the header above by a red line. The terminology used for the tabs should be chosen carefully, as this is what gives the user the first impression of the purpose of the website.

      Behavior:
      Clicking on a tab opens a mega flyout with a menu showing the sub-pages.

      There are different flyout types: e.g. the teaser and the list flyout. In the teaser flyout, the second navigation level, and in the list flyout the second and third navigation levels can be selected directly. This makes it possible to skip navigation nodes for which there are no contents.

      It is also possible to develop and use new flyout types. For instance, a country selection flyout was developed for the EDA.

      The flyout can be closed again by clicking on the “close” function at the top right, the tab at the bottom edge, by clicking on the background, or by clicking on the active tab again.

      Only on the home page are all the tabs closed. If the user navigates in the area below a tab, this tab remains actively selected.

      Add `<div class="overlay"></div>` at the end of the `body` tag to display the gray overlay.

        - added h2 and label to search field on mobile

      **2.1.0:**
        - added the `.nav-mobile` section to the beginning of the `.list-group` element

      **2.0.0:**
        - added `<span class="sr-only">current page</span>` for current active link
        - added `id="main-navigation"`for accessibility nav
        - added `aria-hidden="true"` to close button
  breadcrumb:
    title: Breadcrumb
    help: |
      The breadcrumb is a line of text below the header which shows the user the path, i.e. the position of the web page currently being used within the information architecture of the website. If there is no global navigation feature, the breadcrumb navigation is placed immediately below the red line which closes the header section.

      Thanks to the breadcrumb, users can see at a glance where they are on the site map.

      When the user clicks on a navigation point in the path, the appropriate page opens. When the user clicks on a link on the first or second navigation level (pages which do not have content of their own), an overview page without a navigation pane is opened.

      On smartphones there is always a link at the end of the page to the home page and to the level above. There is no complete breadcrumb on the smartphone version.
  back-to-overview:
    title: Back to Overview
    help: |
      The “back to overview” navigation links pages that do not appear in the navigation to their “parent page”. An example of this can be found in the details page of the publications section.

      The “back to overview” link appears before the page title at the top of the content pane, and at the end of the page before the page-end navigation.
  page-navigation-list:
    title: Page Navigation List (Left Sidebar Navigation)
    help: |
      The sub-navigation on the left sidebar of the content section is a so-called dynamic navigation. It always only shows the page that has currently been selected and the navigation options that page has to offer:

      * Navigation header: the name of the active page has a color bar and is highlighted typographically
      * “Back” link: above the navigation header, there is a link leading back to the previous navigation level
      * Sub-pages: below the navigation header, all of the lower navigation levels are listed as links
      * Sister pages: pages located on the same navigation level as the active page are not listed here. They are accessed via the global navigation or the “back” link. Only on the lowest navigation level, where there are no other sub-pages, are sister pages shown – if there are any.

      ### Behavior

      If a link to a sub-page is clicked on, a new page is loaded. On this page, the selected page is shown as the navigation header. The “back” link leads to the navigation level above, i.e. to the page on which the user has just been. Below the navigation header there are links to the lower navigation levels.

      If a page on the same navigation level as the active page (a sister page) is to be accessed, this is either done via back-linking to the page above or via the global navigation.

      If a page on the lowest navigation level is clicked on (i.e. the selected page has no sub-pages), the navigation is not replaced. Instead, the page currently selected is marked with a red line and the other pages on the same level (sister pages) remain visible.

      ![example](../styleguide-img/navigation_supermarkt.png)

      As long as a page has sub-pages, the navigation head changes dynamically during the navigation (drilling down) process (Step 1). When the lowest level of the navigation tree has been reached, and the pages no longer have sub-pages, only the display changes (Step 2).

      ### Implementation for Smartphones

      On smartphones, the service navigation is shown at the end of the page above the footer.

      ![Left nav on mobile](../styleguide-img/mobile_navi_3.png)

      On smartphones, the subnavigation appears between header and content.
    release: |

      **2.3.0:**

        - added `aria-selected="true"` for current link
        - removed first button in the list (looked like a back link)

          of section

      **2.1.0:**

        - added the optional `.list-emphasis` class to the first `<li>` element. Put it if you need a bolder and darker element in the list.
        - if you want the drilldown behaviour, embed the `.nav-page-list` element in `<div class="drilldown"><div class="drilldown-container"></div></div>` and add some `<nav class="drilldown-sub"></nav>` elements in any `<li>` you want. Add the `.list-sub` class to the `<li>` element too.
  faceted-page-navigation:
    title: Faceted Page Navigation
    help: |
      Faceted navigation serves the purpose of filtering elements (e.g. in a product catalog) on the basis of predefined criteria, so-called facets. These facets are grouped by facet types. A facet which contains subfacets is marked with a triangle.

      ### Behavior:

      After a page with faceted navigation has been loaded, a list containing the facets of the highest level of facet types remains open. The user can open or close any number of other facet types.

      For every facet type, the user can only open one facet; the other facets are hidden. The selected facet type can then no longer be closed.

      If a facet has subfacets, these subfacets are shown after the facet has been selected. The user can then further limit the selection with the help of the subfacets. A selection can be undone with a delete button.

      The contents of the page are adapted to show the selection made in the faceted navigation, and are constantly updated.

      ### Implementation for Smartphones:

      On smartphones, the navigation is accessed via a filter link, and it behaves in the same way as the faceted navigation for desktop computers. Unlike in the desktop version, the contents of the page are only updated when the user closes the faceted navigation.
    release: |
      **2.0.0:**

      - added `aria-selected="true"` for current link
header:
  title: Header

  accessibility-navigation:
    title: Accessibility navigation
    help: |
      The accessibility navigation has to be placed right after the body tag. It is used to give quick access to pages and page areas. **It is invisible**, except when the link is focused.

      Note: Depending on your browser, the accessibility links in the example are displayed after multiple tab presses only. This is due to the webguidelines page using an accessibility navigation itself.
    release: |
      **2.1.8**

        - added `.access-keys` for better accessibility
        - added `#content` to main page content
        - added `#main-navigation` to main page navigation
  service-navigation:
    title: Service navigation
    help: |
      The service navigation is positioned at the top right of the header next to the language selection. It contains links that are of overriding importance (e.g. Contact, Jobs, Media and Contact). Ideally, there should be three, but in no case should there be more than five links in the service navigation.

      On mobile devices the links in the service navigation are moved to the footer.
    release: |
      **2.1.2:**

        - added `h2.sr-only` for more screen reader clarity
  site-search:
    title: Site search
    help: |

      On smartphones, the search function can be accessed via an icon in the Header.
    release: |
      **2.1.2:**
        - added h2.sr-only for more screen reader clarity
        - added label before input for screen readers
  language-selector:
    title: Language Selection via a Link List
    help: |
      The languages available are shown as links, placed side by side, at the top right of the header. For this purpose their two-digit abbreviations as per ISO 639-2 are used (e.g. German: DE, French: FR, Italian: IT, Romansh: RM, English: EN).

      The information and services of the Federal Administration in the web are provided in at least the three official Swiss languages: German, French, and Italian. Romansh, English and other languages are optional and dependent on the requirements of the individual organizational unit and its target groups.

      The following rules apply for the language navigation:

      * German, French and Italian are mandatory. Therefore the abbrevations DE, FR and IT have to be present on each page.
      * The active language is indicated with a light grey background.
      * Inactive languages are indicated as disabled with a light-grey text colour.
      * The abbrevations for Romansh (RM) and English (EN) are shown only when the corresponding content is available.
      * Pages which are not translated can either be omitted or shown as available in the other languages, as in Swiss Embassies (German, French, Italian).

      These rules apply for smartphones as well.

      On smartphones the language selection is always included in a drawer section above the header. This section is hidden automatically as soon as the user scrolls down. If the user scrolls back all the way to the top, the drawer with the language selection reappears.
    release: |
      **3.0.0**
        - added `lang`, `title` and `aria-label` attributes for accessibility

  topics:
    title: Topics A-Z
    help: |
      The topics A-Z search function is an alternative means of accessing the contents of the website. The sub-topics of website can be selected from an alphabetical catalog.

      The topics A-Z section is positioned on the right-hand side of the header. When it is clicked on, a flyout opens which contains an A-Z tab navigation. The topics can also be grouped in other tabs, e.g. according to organizational unit.

      On smartphones, the A-Z navigation is accessed via an icon together with the search function.
    release: |
      **2.1.2:**

    help: |
      The treecrumb navigation shows the position of the current website within the context of all the websites of the Federal Administration. It also serves as an efficient means of accessing information across departments.

      When closed, the treecrumb navigation presents the hierarchical organization of the Federal Administration as a path. When a hierarchical level is clicked on, a menu opens with a collection of links pertinent to the selected hierarchical level.

      On smartphones, the treecrumb navigation is omitted.
    release: |

  tab-navigation:
    title: Tab navigation
    help: |
      Tab navigation is used to group related contents locally within the same page. By way of exception, the font color of the tabs is dark gray (rather than blue) here. The active tab is highlighted with the red bar and the white background color.

      Please note that the contents in the tabs are only used for presentation purposes here. The actual contents are contingent on the purpose of their use (e.g. search results or “further information”).

  site-map:
    title: Site Map and Partners
    help: |
      Links are placed in the footer to make them equally accessible on all pages. These can take the form of a site map linking to pages within the website currently being used, or they can refer to external contents, such as partner websites. If required, the footer can be divided into various sections.

      ### Implementation for Smartphones:

      On smartphones, some of the functions from the header, e.g. service navigation or the full form of the Confederation logo, are moved to the footer.
